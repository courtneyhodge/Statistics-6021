# Testing Hypothesis about Proportions

```{r}
prop.test(40, 100, p = 0.85, alternative = "l")
#our p value is very close to zero (2.2e-16). Since our p-value < 0.01 = alpha, you will reject the null hypothesis!

#note, whenever your p-val < H0, you say that it is a statistically significant result
```
A final project group member tells you that all UVa students sleep for 6
hours on average. Use students from this class as a random sample. Do
you believe your classmate - test your conjecture that all UVa students
sleep more than 6 hours on average? Test at Î± = 0.05.

```{r}
#default is 2 sided 
t.test(OurData5$sleep, mu = 6, alternative = "g")
```
> We will reject the null because p val < alpha.


```{r}
#list the (successes, the sample size)
#Slide pack 2, pg 8
prop.test(c(7, 15), c(15, 19))
#we are 95% confident that the proportion of customers who would select A over B is (-0.694, 0.04)

# we can therefore not make a conclusion about this
